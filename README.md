### Hi there 👋, I’m Gabriele
I was born in 2003 in Rome 🇮🇹, where I currently live.

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree 🎓 in Computer Engineering 💻 at Sapienza University of Rome 🏛️.
I also spent a semester abroad 🌍 as an Erasmus student at the Universitat Politècnica de València 🇪🇸.

Throughout my studies, I’ve collected many exercises 📝 assigned by professors and shared them in public repositories — hoping they might help other students too:
  - [Software Design](https://github.com/cappee/progsoft)
  - [Computing Systems](https://github.com/cappee/sc)

I’m currently working 🚧 on a web-based project for a university exam, and planning another project for my thesis🔍, which is still being defined.

Along the way, I’ve studied and worked with:
  - Java☕
  - Python (also with OOP)🐍
  - C⚙️
  - Assembly (IA-32)🧬
  - SQL🗄️
